<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<p align="center">
  <img src="readme-images/cvtp-desktop.png" width="800">
</p>

A web application that compares the aggregate score given by viewers and reviewers for a particular movie on the Open Movie Database.

The application delivers a memorable user experience on top of a simple concept, with the application aiming to maximise time spent on site. It's designed to be immersive, with neon colours presented against a pitch-black background. It also has a sense of humour, with load spinners and the initial page view accompanied by randomly generated phrases. I kept the shipped features as minimal as possible to provide an excellent experience on smaller screens.

Aside from using the project to learn React, this was also the first project I developed using TDD, using jest as well as React Testing Library.
